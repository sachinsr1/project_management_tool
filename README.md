# project_management_tool

This tool allows groups of workers to put all their task plans in one place, assign themselves to tasks, track the amount of progress made on each task (hourly), and view estimated completion date based on rate of progress demonstrated in the past. 

Check the Wiki for visuals and instructions on how to get started.
